Solutions for the Advent of Code Challenges (https://adventofcode.com/)

The creators of the AoC have asked that the problems and inputs not be hosted publicly.

Therefor the solution folder for each day in this repo contains a link to the "Problem" in the __init__.py file that should link to the question on the AoC site. 

To run the code you will also have to supply an "Input" which can be obtained from the "Problem" on the AoC site. Once you've gotten your input, simply paste it into a file called "Input" in the day's folder.
